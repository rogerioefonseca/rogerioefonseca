### Hi there, Rogerio here ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Go, Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, and CI/CD(Jenkins is not my favorite, I'll be honest, Gitlab Pipelines and GitHub Actions are super!), Cloud Stuffs.
- ðŸ’¬ I use VIM to develop cli tools with Golang, why?. I used to bash scripts until the day that I needed to deliver solutions for Linux, Windows, and MAC users. Then I started to script agnostic with GOLang, with no dependencies to be installed and working at once. :)
- âš¡ I'm almost 40 years old, married, a father of three, and anime(Dragonball, Samurai X, demon slayer, Jujutsu Kiasen and attack on Titan are in the top of my list) fan
