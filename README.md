### Hi there, Rogerio here ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Go, Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm and CI/CD(Jenkins is not my favorite, I'll be honest, Gitlab Pipelines and Github Actions are super!), Cloud Stuffs.
- ðŸ’¬ I do use vim and develop cli tools with golang, why?. I used to bash script until the day that I needed to deliver solutions for Linux, Windows and MAC users. Then I started to scripting agnostic with GOLang, with no dependencies to be installed and working at once. :)
- âš¡ I'm a 38 almost 39 years old, married, father of three and anime(Dragonball, Samurai X, demon slayer and attack on titan are in the top of my list) fan
